# Incorrect Usage of $inc Operator in MongoDB Aggregation

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator within MongoDB's aggregation framework.  The `$inc` operator is intended for incrementing numeric fields; attempting to use it on non-numeric fields or in ways that violate its functionality can result in errors and unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code snippet showcases an incorrect application of the `$inc` operator within an aggregation pipeline. It attempts to increment a numeric field using an array which is not supported.

## Solution
The solution involves correctly utilizing the `$add` operator for adding values to numeric fields within the aggregation pipeline or, depending on the intent, using other aggregation operations to achieve the desired result. The corrected JavaScript code provides the proper solution.
